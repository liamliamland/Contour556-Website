# Contour556-Website# Contour556Website

The Contour556 website was built to showcase the home, contact and about page. Each section contains the relevant infomation for a user to navigate, although it is important to note that hte website was designed without quality user testing or heuristics. 

## The plan 

To begin planning for the website, a mindmap was created to help identify the correct users. The insights from this mind map helped show that our users were likely families, older adults and artsits/designers. Taking into account my own level of experience, the aim was to design a miminalistic website. The site map was as follows:

- Top navigation
- Homepage 

    - Introductary information
    - Past festivals
    - Sponsor list
    - News

- About page

    - About information
    - The Contour556 team

- Contact us page 

    - Phone number
    - Email address
    - Social media
    - Address
    - Message box

- Footer

This was then turned into a quick lo fidelity wireframe where it underwent a number of iterations. From here, Figma was used to create a more high-fidelity mockup. Lastly, HTML5, CSS and JQuery was used to create the final prototype. 

## Final reflections

I used a number of in course and external resources to learn and develope this website. I find online to be my most successful mode of learning however for this particular course, if I were to do it again, would be better done in person. This was my own mistake and there were a number of times I led myself down the wrong path. A good example was creating the website first before adapting any media queries. This made turning it into a responsive website much more difficult than if I had built it to be responsive from the beginning.
